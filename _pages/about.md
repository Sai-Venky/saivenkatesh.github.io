I am currently working as a software development engineer at Samsung Electronics India on building the `Global Platform V2` product. I am also working in Product Lab's `AI-Based Mid-Course Tracker for Missile Seeker Application` project at IIIT-Hyderabad under `Dr. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla`. My current research activities are focused on `Tracking and Trajectory forecasting`. I am working on building a continuous architecture capable of performing both the tasks in a single shot parallel manner by combining extracted Spatial and Temporal features.<br><br>
I graduated with a B.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering from Anna University.
